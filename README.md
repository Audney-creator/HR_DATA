## HR Data Analysis with Power BI
---

## Project Overview
---
This project involves analyzing HR data using Power BI to gain insights into employee attrition, demographics, and job satisfaction. The analysis includes data preparation, creating visuals, and calculating key HR metrics to aid in decision-making.

## Data
---
The data for this project was sourced from our Learning Management System (LMS), which makes it not an open-sourced data. The dataset was already clean, and this allowed for a seamless transition to analysis and ensured that calculations and insights were accurate from the start.


## Objectives
---
Analyze employee attrition and identify patterns across departments, age groups, job roles, and other demographics.
Develop visuals to effectively communicate insights, utilizing Power BIâ€™s advanced features like measures, conditional columns, and AI visuals.


## Tools used
---
Power BI for data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and insight generation.


## Steps and Analysis
---
**- Employee Count**
* Calculated the total count of employees within the dataset.

**- Attrition Analysis**
* Created a conditional column to calculate attrition and used Power BI's AI visuals to explore attrition patterns.
* Used card visuals to highlight key numbers like total employees, attrition count, and attrition rate.
* Calculated the attrition rate and average employee age using measures.

**- Visualization by Department**
* Utilized donut and pie charts to display attrition count segmented by department.

**- Employee Demographics Analysis**
* Analyzed current employees by age group and gender using filters and visuals.
* Resolved sorting issues by creating a conditional column for age bands.

  
**- Marital Status and Gender Summary**
* Summed the number of current employees, broken down by marital status and gender.

  
**- Job Roles and Slicers**
* Added a slicer to filter by job roles for deeper exploration of specific positions.

  
**- Job Satisfaction and Educational Field**
* Used a matrix to show job satisfaction by educational field, filtered by attrition status.
  
**- Attrition by Age Group**
* Filtered and analyzed attrition across different age groups for more detailed insights.

## Key Insights
---
The organization had an attrition rate of 16%, indicating significant turnover within the workforce. The R&D department had the highest attrition count, suggesting a need for targeted retention strategies in this area. Furthermore, employees with a background in life sciences represented the highest attrition count by education field, highlighting a potential vulnerability in retaining specialized talent. Additionally, male employees had the highest attrition count by gender, pointing to possible issues in engagement or satisfaction among male staff.
